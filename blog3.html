        <h3> My Thoughts</h3>

        <p>Godan is a book that sent me through an emotional rollercoaster. This is a book that is so true to the story,
            that if at the end there were a line, “Based on a true story” I wouldn’t be surprised. The raw emotion that
            was induced by this book makes it really hard to write this review, as there’s so much going on which I am
            incapable of putting into words. And that is where the beauty and dexterity of Munshi Premchand are visible.
            Through this book, he has evoked emotions that couldn’t be explained or spoken out. He doesn’t tell what is
            to be felt, and yet you feel every emotion that you are capable of.

            The story has a whole lot of characters with each having their own essence, imperfections dabbling in the
            ironies of what they believe in and what they do. The protagonist, Hori who is a simple farmer who has a
            dream of owning a cow which is considered sacred in India and is a sign of virtue and respect in the
            society. Hori is a simple man and people take advantage of him. He is a person who succumbs to his
            traditions, superstitions and valueswith a pressure cooker of a wife Dhaniya who flares up at anything that
            she doesn’t like but has a soft heart! The book features the stories of his three children Gobar, Rupa and
            Sona who each has their own story arcs. It is a story of aspirations that go unfulfilled and leave the poor
            to always stay poor.

            The story talks about the injustice of the society that has created a world where the elite ensure the poor
            don’t get to rise and yet always strive for their betterment while not demonising the rich for they have
            their own virtues and place in the working of the world to make it a better place. The story talks about how
            people move to urban areas to find a better lifestyle and what happens there.
            #whathappensinthecitystaysinthecity apparently. It is a wonder how the society and peoples own superstitions
            and unfair traditions leave them bereft of growth even when the rich offer a helping hand. It is also
            fascinating to see the stark differences between the elite and the poor when they face adversity where the
            elite get to stand up again while the poor are pushed back into poverty and are enslaved by situations not
            under their control.

            These deep rooted thoughts come up to the surface through the beauty of the language used by Premchand. Such
            eloquent writing, with the right amount of descriptions and describing his philosophies through amazing
            analogies was just poetic. The experience of reading and listening to the audiobook helped accentuate the
            overall experience of the book by making you the silent spectator in the background throughout the story.
            But just like Cooper w-hose screams from behind the cupboard in the fifth dimension went unheard to little
            Brand, I tried so hard to reach out to the characters to laugh with them and offer my shoulder, I just could
            not. And that is how beautiful the book was written!

            What I really love about the book is the depth in the story and the aftertaste of realising that things
            haven’t changed much in the Indian rural setting even today! The poor remain poor and the rich grow rich.
            The last few pages where the title is justified is something that left me in tears and I needed to take a
            small break from reading to assimilate what happened. No, the book isn’t depressing as I make it sound, the
            book is about life and everything in it, with great mountains and valleys, days and nights, love and
            adultery, riches and wealth, growth and failures. The book is the whole package.

        <h3>My Recommendation </h3>
        <p>

            I would recommend this book to everyone and it is such a great book that I have selected this to be the book
            from India in the Project Cross Borders where I aim to read atleast one book from each country.

            For the people who understand Hindi, I would suggest them to pick up the audiobook while those fluent in
            reading Hindi should try reading and listening for the best experience! And for the rest of the world, the
            book is available in English as “The Gift of A Cow” translated by Gordon C Roadamel! This is one book that
            has to be read by anyone and without doubt, I would rate it
            Spoiler Free Review

            Godan is considered to be one of Hindi’s most famous and revered novel which was Munshi Premchand’s final
            and best work. I have wanted to read this book for over ten years now and it feels great to have finally
            read it. I read the book and heard the audiobook simultaneously which made the experience all the more
            better and wholesome. I began to read this book to be a part of Project India where I am reading one book
            from each state in India.I loved it so much that I believe each person should read this atleast once and
            hence put this up for the world to read in Project Cross Borders where I aim to read atleast one book from
            each member nation of the United Nations. </p>
