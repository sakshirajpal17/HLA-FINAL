        <h1>MYTH of the ENTREPRENEUR</h1>
        <img src="Myth-of-the-Entrepreneur-by-Ravi-Kailas-Kathy-Guo.webp" alt="">
        <h3>My musings</h3>
        <p>
            Since the last two months, I’ve been quite interested in reading books on spirituality. Gaur Gopal Das and
            Sadhguru are two authors whose books I’ve been meaning to read for quite some time now.

            I got a chance to read a book about entrepreneurship recently and quite unexpectedly, it turned out to be a
            read that was all about the mind, the soul and about achieving a balance in life.

            Ravi Kailas and Cathy Guo’s Myth of the Entrepreneur is a book that made me reflect a lot on my life and the
            work that I do, albeit in a positive and profound way.

            It is on this book that I am going to be sharing my thoughts on today. So, read on to know more about what I
            think of this amazing book and my reasons for you to read it. </p>

        <h3>What to expect? </h3>
        <p>
            Expect a book that is part memoir part self-help. Expect a book that makes you ponder and reflect on the
            true meaning of value creation and on the purpose of life.

            Expect a book that is full of anecdotes and life experiences of a successful serial entrepreneur.

            Finally, expect a book that calls for a paradigm shift in the way the entrepreneurial ecosystem works in
            India and abroad.</p>
        <h3>What is the book all about? </h3>
        <p>
            Myth of the Entrepreneur is a book that tells us the story of its author Ravi Kailas, a serial entrepreneur
            who has successfully set-up and run many profitable companies in his life. The book though talking about
            business lessons and experiences focuses more on the author’s search for true value and its creation while
            setting up and running such business.

            The author explores the real meaning of being an entrepreneur which entails creating value not for one’s
            personal self but also for society and the entire ecosystem.

            The author also focuses on spirituality and the need to maintain a healthy balance between work and personal
            life. </p>

        <h3>The entrepreneur’s dilemma </h3>
        <p>
            Today’s world is such that entrepreneurs have become the real heroes of the globalized world. While there is
            definitely more development and more money in the world, one simply cannot oversee the crude fact that the
            income disparity is on an ever-increasing trend.

            The rich are becoming richer and the poor are still struggling for one square meal a day. Is this indicator
            of the ever-widening rich-poor divide a healthy one?

            In the face of such sharp contrasts, can the entrepreneur afford to think only for himself and not for the
            society as a whole? How long can such an unjust system be sustained? And what is the true meaning of value
            creation?


            This is the Myth of the Entrepreneur; the entrepreneur’s dilemma – how to create value that benefits not
            just one but all? </p>
        <h3>In the end </h3>
        <p>
            In the end, I believe that Myth of the Entrepreneur is a book that is a must-read for every single
            businessman, entrepreneur and business graduate.

            It is a book that gives us some serious points to reflect on while influencing our thought process for the
            greater good. Written in a crisp and a no-nonsense manner, the book is as interesting as it is informative.
