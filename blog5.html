        <h3> My musings </h3>
        <p>
            This year has seen me reading a lot of poetry, both in English and Hindi. It was only last month that I read
            this amazing shayari collection called Jo Tum Kaho by Prashant V Srivastava and now I have got my hands on
            yet another beautiful book of Urdu shayaris.

            Ravi Kumar’s Kaagaz Ke Mahal is a book that speaks to your heart. With its soulful shayaris (शायरी) and
            witty shers (शेर), the book manages to impress the reader in no time.
        <h3>The shayaris</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            The language is poetic and melodious and the shayaris manage to carry many meanings all at once. As the
            author states at the beginning of the book, the shayaris might appeal to individual readers differently
            because they carry different meanings for different people at different stages of life.

            I also appreciate the way the shayaris have been named intelligently. Named after abstract themes like
            feelings, objects, and emotions – each one of them is quite special in its own way.
        </p>
        <h3>The themes that are explored </h3>
        <p>
            The shayaris in Kaagaz Ke Mahal explore various themes. They often oscillate between contrasting themes of
            love and betrayal, hope and dismay, regret and gratitude. While reading them, it is pretty obvious that they
            are penned by channeling emotions straight from the heart. Such beautiful poetry can only be written by
            somebody who has loved and/or has lost in love.

            The memories of first love, that overpowering bliss and the heady feeling of anticipation – all of it comes
            alive in these shayaris. Even while talking about pain, the shayaris manage to rekindle those memories with
            a rose-tinted hue.
        </p>
        <h3>The physical aspects </h3>
        <p>
            Physical aspects of the book have also been taken good care of. The cover looks appealing and the blurb is
            exciting too. The layout of the book including finer details like page formatting, font style, font size,
            and paragraph spacing have been given adequate attention thus overall making it a book worth possessing.
        </p>
        <h3>In the end </h3>

        <p>In the end, Kaagaz Ke Mahal is a book that explores abstract themes and feelings while indulging our
            emotional side. It is a book that ought to be celebrated and not just because it is well written, but also
            because it enables one to celebrate love and also pain; to find beauty in both and revel in the warmth of
            old memories.
