        <h3>My Musings </h3>
        <p>
            Many times, in the process of writing, some authors blur the lines between fiction and nonfiction. They
            structure a book around a story but the soul of the book remains that of self-help. These past few months, I
            have had the pleasure of reading not one but two such books – Vibhor Kumar Singh’s The Billionaire and the
            Monk, and Late Dr. Shweta Shahi’s Unleash the Power Called You… You Matter.

            Fortunately, I recently came across another similar read that not just enlightened me but also gave some
            essential life lessons. Read on to know more about Munazir Hussain’s The Un-Religious Saint. </p>
        <h3>What to expect? </h3>
        <p>
            Expect a book that narrates a simple story. Expect a book that has a lot of life lessons and practical
            wisdom. Expect a book that attempts to make the reader a better individual. Expect a book that is easy to
            read. Finally, expect a book that is essentially nonfiction self-help in the garb of a fictional story.

        </p>
        <h3>Let’s talk about the storyline </h3>
        <p>
            Adil is the son of middle-class parents, who on a visit to a Sufi shrine, chances upon the beautiful
            Naazneen. One look at the ethereal beauty, and Adil falls head over heels in love with her. What follows is
            a restless journey of pursuing and wooing the girl, until she decides to give in. But alas, Adil’s life is
            fraught with hardships, as one after the other, life takes him on a roller coaster that is bound to teach
            him lessons that will change his outlook towards life.

            The Un-Religious Saint is the story of Adil’s journey in life; a journey where is he assisted and guided by
            a mystic power that seems to have a bigger purpose for him.

        <h3>Life lessons to be learned </h3>
        <p>
            There are many takeaways from the book. There are plenty of life lessons to be learned along with examples.
            With the help of a simple storyline and the situations the main character finds himself in, the author tries
            to impart many a great knowledge. These lessons not just deal with spiritual pursuits (like the title of the
            book suggests), but they also dole out much-needed advice in practical aspects of life like relationships,
            truth, trust, goals, ambition, financial wisdom, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>In the end </h3>
        <p>
            In the end, The Un-Religious Saint narrates a simple story of a great transformation and self-discovery.
            Don’t be fooled by the drab cover, for the book contains some great life lessons for anyone who wishes to
            gain from the wisdom that it contains. I, for sure, had a good time reading and learning from it.
