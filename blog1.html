        <h3>Do Murder Mysteries intrigue you?</h3>

        <p>An Invitation to Die by Tanushree Podder is based in the quaint hill town of Ramsar, where it begins with a
            simple mystery of Violet William’s van going missing after her granddaughter Pia forgets to lock it when she
            used it to cater to a party. Things take a turn when ASP Timothy Thapa finds the missing van, albeit with a
            dead body inside it. Here enters Colonel Acharya, Ramsar’s very own sleuth, with his merry band of
            bridge-playing Watsons. As the investigation progresses, secrets tumble out of the closet, and it dawns on
            the people that things are not always what they seem. The question is, will the killer be identified, or
            this murder will remain a mystery?

            I love a well-cooked murder mystery and this story ticks off all the boxes for me. The storyline is
            well-plotted, and the execution is excellent, specially keeping the identity of perpetrator a secret. The
            storytelling is engaging and the buildup while introducing the plot is just right. The descriptions are
            vivid, and it engages the mind to create a visual imagery as things unfold, keeping the reader hooked. The
            one aspect that stood out for me in the story was how the blame was squarely placed on a person, but the
            sleuthing continues to reach a conclusion. Tanushree gives all suspects a believable motive of the crime,
            and for a moment, I was drawn into a world very similar to Baker Street and imagining Colonel Acharya as
            Holmes. The climax is well-executed and the way it closes this murder mystery yet keeps the door ajar for
            further stories is well-appreciated. I would love to read more of the adventures of Colonel Acharya for he
            promises to be a detective who can develop a cult following.

            Another interesting part of the story are its characters, specially with a motley of interesting residents
            of Ramsar. The characters are well-sketched and are a critical part of the storytelling. Starting from Pia,
            her character is sketched in a manner that introduces her sufficiently to be a crucial part in the further
            adventures of Colonel Acharya. Her café is a wonderful part of the story that becomes a part of the story in
            an integral manner. Another character I liked was that of ASP Thapa and how he juggles between respecting
            orders and respecting the duty to dispense justice. His interactions with the DGP and with the Colonel are
            enlightening as well as entertaining.

            Overall, this is a murder mystery I would recommend to you if you are a Christie or a Doyle fan for the
            sheer brilliance in storytelling and a crafty murder mystery. The book scores a 4.91/5 for me.
